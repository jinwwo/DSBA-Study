## Overview
This repository summarizes the study activities for new students of the DSBA Lab for the Fall 2025 semester. 
The program covers **three key domains**:
- Computer Vision (CV)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Time-Series Analysis

The primary goal is to build both foundational and applied skills in these areas through:
- Paper reviews
- Model experiments 
- Code implementation and review
- Result sharing and discussion

Each session consisted of presentations followed by collaborative code reviews and experiment result sharing.
